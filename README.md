6CH Eurorack trigger sequencer and euclidean Rhythm Generator with SSD1306 0.96 OLED

This is our take on a PCB version of the HAGIWO 6 Channel OLED sequencer.

The module is a Arduino-based 6CH Eurorack trigger sequencer and euclidean Rhythm Generator with SSD1306 0.96 OLED.

It can be clocked via input and offers an additional reset input.
Also it is easy to modify / reprogramm it easily with the Arduino IDE.

Currently there are a few ideas floating around for further expanding / alternating the FW.
